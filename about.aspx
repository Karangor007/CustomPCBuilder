                               We're a team of engineers, modders, gamers and tech enthusiasts. We happen to build the fastest Custom PC builders in India. We build them mean and build them fast for gamers, speed demons, content creators, data scientists, Machine learning experts, and just about anyone who wants the latest and greatest in tech.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As cliched as it sounds, we are insanely passionate about gaming and everything related to tech. We managed to fit in 16 long years of education in between bouts of endless gaming. In 2015, we realized that we'd rather geek out on the latest tech than do regular 9-5 jobs. Quitting our day jobs, we decided that pc hardware, and everything related to it should be our day job. And so, CustomPCBuider.Com was born.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since then, our biggest driving force has been spreading the joy of gaming - and reading / hearing satisfied gamers giving their honest feedback. If you've been following us for a while - you are seeing version three of our website here, and we’re committed to build as many versions as it would take to learn and incorporate elements that would make the journey to your dream PC simpler.
